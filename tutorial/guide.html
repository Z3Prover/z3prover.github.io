See what the tool says, try your own formulas, and experiment!</p> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p> Z3 is a state-of-the art theorem prover from Microsoft Research. It can be used to check the satisfiability of logical formulas over one or more theories. Z3 offers a compelling match for software analysis and verification tools, since several common software constructs map directly into supported theories. </p> <p> The main objective of the tutorial is to introduce the reader on how to use Z3 effectively for logical modeling and solving. The tutorial provides some general background on logical modeling, but we have to defer a full introduction to first-order logic and decision procedures to text-books. </p> <p> Z3 is a low level tool. It is best used as a component in the context of other tools that require solving logical formulas. Consequently, Z3 exposes a number of API facilities to make it convenient for tools to map into Z3, but there are no stand-alone editors or user-centric facilities for interacting with Z3. The language syntax used in the front ends favor simplicity in contrast to linguistic convenience. </p> <h2>Basic Commands</h2> <p> The Z3 input format is an extension of the one defined by the <a href="http://www.smtlib.org/" target="_blank">SMT-LIB 2.0 standard</a>. A Z3 script is a sequence of commands. The <b>help</b> command displays a list of all available commands. The command <b>echo</b> displays a message. Internally, Z3 maintains a <b>stack</b> of user provided formulas and declarations. We say these are the <b>assertions</b> provided by the user. The command <b>declare-const</b> declares a constant of a given type (aka sort). The command <b>declare-fun</b> declares a function. In the following example, we declared a function that receives an integer and a boolean, and returns an integer. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.1">
(echo "starting Z3...")
(declare-const a Int)
(declare-fun f (Int Bool) Int)
</pre> <p> The command <b>assert</b> adds a formula into the Z3 internal stack. We say the set of formulas in the Z3 stack is <b>satisfiable</b> if there is an interpretation (for the user declared constants and functions) that makes all asserted formulas true. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.2">
(declare-const a Int)
(declare-fun f (Int Bool) Int)
(assert (> a 10))
(assert (< (f a true) 100))
(check-sat)
</pre> <p> The first asserted formula states that the constant <tt>a</tt> must be greater than 10. The second one states that the function <tt>f</tt> applied to <tt>a</tt> and <tt>true</tt> must return a value less than 100. The command <b>check-sat</b> determines whether the current formulas on the Z3 stack are satisfiable or not. If the formulas are satisfiable, Z3 returns <b>sat</b>. If they are not satisfiable (i.e., they are <b>unsatisfiable</b>), Z3 returns <b>unsat</b>. Z3 may also return <b>unknown</b> when it can't determine whether a formula is satisfiable or not. </p> <p> When the command check-sat returns <b>sat</b>, the command <b>get-model</b> can be used to retrieve an interpretation that makes all formulas on the Z3 internal stack true. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.3">
(declare-const a Int)
(declare-fun f (Int Bool) Int)
(assert (> a 10))
(assert (< (f a true) 100))
(check-sat)
(get-model)
</pre> <p> The interpretation is provided using <b>definitions</b>. For example, the definition: </p> <pre>
(define-fun a () Int [val])
</pre> <p> states that the value of <tt>a</tt> in the model is <tt>[val]</tt>. The definition: </p> <pre>
(define-fun f ((x!1 Int) (x!2 Bool)) Int
   ...
)
</pre> <p> is very similar to a function definition used in programming languages. In this example, <tt>x1</tt> and <tt>x2</tt> are the arguments of the function interpretation created by Z3. For this simple example, the definition of <tt>f</tt> is based on <b>ite</b>'s (aka if-then-elses or conditional expressions). For example, the expression: </p> <pre>
(ite (and (= x!1 11) (= x!2 false)) 21 0)
</pre> <p> evaluates (returns) 21 when <tt>x!1</tt> is equal to 11, and <tt>x!2</tt> is equal to false. Otherwise, it returns 0. </p> <h3>Using Scopes</h3> <p> In some applications, we want to explore several similar problems that share several definitions and assertions. We can use the commands <b>push</b> and <b>pop</b> for doing that. Z3 maintains a global stack of declarations and assertions. The command <tt>push</tt> creates a new scope by saving the current stack size. The command <tt>pop</tt> removes any assertion or declaration performed between it and the matching push. The <tt>check-sat</tt> and <tt>get-assertions</tt> commands always operate on the content of the global stack. </p> <p>In the following example, the command <tt>(assert p)</tt> signs an error because the <tt>pop</tt> command removed the declaration for <tt>p</tt>. If the last <tt>pop</tt> command is removed, then the error is corrected. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.29">
(declare-const x Int)
(declare-const y Int)
(declare-const z Int)
(push)
(assert (= (+ x y) 10))
(assert (= (+ x (* 2 y)) 20))
(check-sat)
(pop) ; remove the two assertions
(push) 
(assert (= (+ (* 3 x) y) 10))
(assert (= (+ (* 2 x) (* 2 y)) 21))
(check-sat)
(declare-const p Bool)
(pop)
(assert p) ; error, since declaration of p was removed from the stack
</pre> <p>The <tt>push</tt> and <tt>pop</tt> commands can optionally receive a numeral argument as specifed by the SMT 2 language. </p> <h3>Configuration</h3> <p>The command <b>set-option</b> is used to configure Z3. Z3 has several options to control its behavior. Some of these options (e.g., <tt>:produce-proofs</tt>) can only be set before any declaration or assertion. We use the <b>reset</b> command to erase all assertions and declarations. After the <tt>reset</tt> command, all configuration options can be set. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.30">
(set-option :print-success true) 
(set-option :produce-unsat-cores true) ; enable generation of unsat cores
(set-option :produce-models true) ; enable model generation
(set-option :produce-proofs true) ; enable proof generation
(declare-const x Int)
(set-option :produce-proofs false) ; error, cannot change this option after a declaration or assertion
(echo "before reset")
(reset)
(set-option :produce-proofs false) ; ok
</pre> <p> The option <tt>:print-success true</tt> is particularly useful when Z3 is being controlled by another application using pipes. In this mode, commands, that otherwise would not print any output, will print <tt>success</tt>. </p> <h3>Additional commands</h3> <p>The command <b>(display t)</b> just applies the Z3 pretty printer to the given expression. The command <b>(simplify t)</b> displays a possibly simpler expression equivalent to <tt>t</tt>. This command accepts many different options, <tt>(help simplify)</tt> will display all available options. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.31">

</pre> <p> The <b>define-sort</b> command defines a new sort symbol that is an abbreviation for a sort expression. The new sort symbol can be parameterized, in which case the names of the parameters are specified in the command and the sort expression uses the sort parameters. The form of the command is this: </p> <pre>
(define-sort [symbol] ([symbol]+) [sort])
</pre> <p> The following example defines several abbreviations for sort expressions. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.55">

</pre> <h2>Propositional Logic</h2> <p> The pre-defined sort <bb>Bool</bb> is the sort (type) of all Boolean propositional expressions. Z3 supports the usual Boolean operators <tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, <tt>xor</tt>, <tt>not</tt>, <tt>=></tt> (implication), <tt>ite</tt> (if-then-else). Bi-implications are represented using equatity <tt>=</tt>. The following example shows how to prove that if <tt>p</tt> implies <tt>q</tt> and <tt>q</tt> implies <tt>r</tt>, then <tt>p</tt> implies <tt>r</tt>. We accomplish that by showing that the negation is unsatisfiable. The command <bb>define-fun</bb> is used to define a macro (aka alias). In this example, <tt>conjecture</tt> is an alias for the conjecture we want to prove. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.4">
(declare-const p Bool)
(declare-const q Bool)
(declare-const r Bool)

(check-sat)
</pre> <h3>Satisfiability and Validity</h3> <p>A formula <tt>F</tt> is <b>valid</b> if <tt>F</tt> always evaluates to true for any assignment of appropriate values to its uninterpreted function and constant symbols. A formula <tt>F</tt> is <b>satisfiable</b> if there is some assignment of appropriate values to its uninterpreted function and constant symbols under which <tt>F</tt> evaluates to true. Validity is about finding a proof of a statement; satisfiability is about finding a solution to a set of constraints. Consider a formula <tt>F</tt> with some uninterpreted constants, say <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>. We can ask whether <tt>F</tt> is valid, that is whether it is always true for any combination of values for <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>. If <tt>F</tt> is always true, then <tt>not F</tt> is always false, and then <tt>not F</tt> will not have any satisfying assignment; that is, <tt>not F</tt> is unsatisfiable. That is, <tt>F</tt> is valid precisely when <tt>not F</tt> is not satisfiable (is unsatisfiable). Alternately, <tt>F</tt> is satisfiable if and only if <tt>not F</tt> is not valid (is invalid). Z3 finds satisfying assignments (or report that there are none). To determine whether a formula <tt>F</tt> is valid, we ask Z3 whether <tt>not F</tt> is satisfiable. Thus, to check the deMorgan's law is valid (i.e., to prove it), we show its negation to be unsatisfiable.</p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.5">

</pre> <h2>Uninterpreted functions and constants</h2> <p> The basic building blocks of SMT formulas are constants and functions. Constants are just functions that take no arguments. So everything is really just a function. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.33">

</pre> <p> Unlike programming languages, where functions have side-effects, can throw exceptions, or never return, functions in classical first-order logic have no side-effects and are <b>total</b>. That is, they are defined on all input values. This includes functions, such as division. </p> <p> Function and constant symbols in pure first-order logic are <i>uninterpreted</i> or <i>free</i>, which means that no a priori interpretation is attached. This is in contrast to functions belonging to the signature of theories, such as arithmetic where the function <tt>+</tt> has a fixed standard interpretation (it adds two numbers). Uninterpreted functions and constants are maximally flexible; they allow any interpretation that is consistent with the constraints over the function or constant. </p> <p> To illustrate uninterpreted functions and constants let us introduce an (uninterpreted) sort <tt>A</tt>, and the constants <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt> ranging over <tt>A</tt>. Finally let <tt>f</tt> be an uninterpreted function that takes one argument of sort <tt>A</tt> and results in a value of sort <tt>A</tt>. The example illustrates how one can force an interpretation where <tt>f</tt> applied twice to <tt>x</tt> results in <tt>x</tt> again, but <tt>f</tt> applied once to <tt>x</tt> is different form <tt>x</tt>. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.32">

</pre> <p> The resulting model introduces abstract values for the elements in <tt>A</tt>, because the sort <tt>A</tt> is uninterpreted. The interpretation for <tt>f</tt> in the model toggles between the two values for <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>, which are different. </p> <h2>Arithmetic</h2> <p> Z3 has builtin support for integer and real constants. This two types should not be confused with machine integers (32-bit or 64-bit) and floating point numbers. These two types (sorts) represent the mathematical integers and reals. The command <b>declare-const</b> is used to declare integer and real constants. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.6">

(declare-const b Int)

(declare-const e Real)
</pre> <p> After constants are declared, the user can assert.smt formulas containing these constants. The formulas contain arithmetic operators such as: <tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt>, and so on. The command <b>check-sat</b> will instruct Z3 to try to find an interpretation for the declared constants that makes all formulas true. The interpretation is basically assigning a number to each constant. If such interpretation exists, we say it is a <b>model</b> for the asserted formulas. The command <b>get-model</b> displays the model built by Z3. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.7">

</pre> <h3>Nonlinear arithmetic</h3> <p> We say a formula is <b>nonlinear</b> if it contains expressions of the form <b>(* t s)</b> where <tt>t</tt> and <tt>s</tt> are not numbers. Nonlinear real arithmetic is very expensive, and Z3 is not complete for this kind of formula. The command <b>check-sat</b> may return <b>unknown</b> or loop. Nonlinear integer arithmetic is <b>undecidable</b>: there is no procedure that is correct and terminates (for every input) with a <b>sat</b> or <b>unsat</b> answer. Yes, it is <b>impossible</b> to build such procedure. Note that, this does not prevent Z3 from returning an answer for many nonlinear problems. The real limit is that there will always be a nonlinear integer arithmetic formula that it will fail produce an answer. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.9">

</pre> <h2>Bitvectors</h2> <p> Modern CPUs and main-stream programming languages use arithmetic over fixed-size bit-vectors. The theory of bit-vectors allows modeling the precise semantics of unsigned and of signed two-complements arithmetic. There are a large number of supported functions and relations over bit-vectors. They are summarized on Z3's <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/z3/documentation.html" target="_blank">on-line documentation</a> of the binary APIs and they are summarized on the <a href="http://www.smtlib.org" target="_blank">SMT-LIB</a> web-site. We will not try to give a comprehensive overview here, but touch on some of the main features. </p> <p> In contrast to programming languages, such as C, C++, C#, Java, there is no distinction between signed and unsigned bit-vectors as numbers. Instead, the theory of bit-vectors provides special signed versions of arithmetical operations where it makes a difference whether the bit-vector is treated as signed or unsigned. </p> <p> Z3 supports Bitvectors of arbitrary size. <tt>(_ BitVec n)</tt> is the sort of bitvectors whose length is <tt>n</tt>. Bitvector literals may be defined using binary, decimal and hexadecimal notation. In the binary and hexadecimal cases, the bitvector size is inferred from the number of characters. For example, the bitvector literal <tt>#b010</tt> in binary format is a bitvector of size 3, and the bitvector literal <tt>#x0a0</tt> in hexadecimal format is a bitvector of size 12. The size must be specified for bitvector literals in decimal format. For example, <tt>(_ bv10 32)</tt> is a bitvector of size 32 that representes the numeral <tt>10</tt>. By default, Z3 display bitvectors in hexadecimal format if the bitvector size is a multiple of 4, and in binary otherwise. The command <tt>(set-option :pp.bv-literals false)</tt> can be used to force Z3 to display bitvector literals in decimal format. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.24">

</pre> <h2>Arrays</h2> <p>As part of formulating a programme of a mathematical theory of computation McCarthy proposed a <i>basic</i> theory of arrays as characterized by the select-store axioms. The expression <tt>(select a i)</tt> returns the value stored at position <tt>i</tt> of the array <tt>a</tt>; and <tt>(store a i v)</tt> returns a new array identical to <tt>a</tt>, but on position <tt>i</tt> it contains the value <tt>v</tt>. </p> <p> Z3 contains a decision procedure for the basic theory of arrays. By default, Z3 assumes that arrays are extensional over select. In other words, Z3 also enforces that if two arrays agree on all reads, then the arrays are equal. </p> <p> It also contains various extensions for operations on arrays that remain decidable and amenable to efficient saturation procedures (here efficient means, with an NP-complete satisfiability complexity). We describe these extensions in the following using a collection of examples. Additional background on these extensions is available in the paper <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leonardo/fmcad09.pdf" target="_blank">Generalized and Efficient Array Decision Procedures</a>. </p> <h3>Select and Store</h3> <p>Let us first check a basic property of arrays.

It takes one value from the range type of the array and creates an array. Z3 cannot infer what kind of array must be returned by the <tt>const</tt> construct by just inspecting the argument type. Thus, a qualified identifier <tt>(as const (Array T1 T2))</tt> must be used. The following example defines a constant array containing only ones. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.21">

</pre> <h3>Array models</h3> <p> Models provide interpretations of the uninterpreted (aka free) constants and functions that appear in the satisfiable formula. An interpretation for arrays is very similar to the interpretation of a function. Z3 uses the construct <tt>(_ as-array f)</tt> to give the interpretation for arrays. If the array <tt>a</tt> is equal to <tt>(_ as-array f)</tt>, then for every index <tt>i</tt>, <tt>(select a i)</tt> is equal to <tt>(f i)</tt>. In the previous example, Z3 creates the auxiliary function <tt>k!0</tt> to assign an interpretation to the array constant <tt>all1</tt>. </p> <h3>Mapping Functions on Arrays</h3> <p> In the following, we will simulate basic Boolean algebra (set theory) using the array theory extensions in Z3. Z3 provides a parametrized <tt>map</tt> function on arrays. It allows applying arbitrary functions to the range of arrays. The following example illustrates how to use the <tt>map</tt> function. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.22">

A bag is here an array that maps elements to their multiplicity. Main bag operations include <tt>union</tt>, obtained by adding multiplicity, <tt>intersection</tt>, by taking the minimum multiplicity, and a dual <tt>join</tt> operation that takes the maximum multiplicity. In the following example, we define the bag-union using <tt>map</tt>.

</pre> <h2>Datatypes</h2> <p> Algebraic datatypes, known from programming languages such as ML, offer a convenient way for specifying common data structures. Records and tuples are special cases of algebraic datatypes, and so are scalars (enumeration types). But algebraic datatypes are more general. They can be used to specify finite lists, trees and other recursive structures. </p> <h3>Records</h3> <p>A record is specified as a datatype with a single constructor and as many arguments as record elements. The number of arguments to a record are always the same. The type system does not allow to extend records and there is no record subtyping. </p> <p> The following example illustrates that two records are equal only if all the arguments are equal. It introduces the parametric type <tt>Pair</tt>, with constructor <tt>mk-pair</tt> and two arguments that can be accessed using the selector functions <tt>first</tt> and <tt>second</tt>. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.13">

For example, the sort <tt>S</tt> is a scalar type with three values <tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt> and <tt>C</tt>. It is possible for three constants of sort <tt>S</tt> to be distinct, but not for four constants. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.14">

</pre> <h3>Recursive datatypes</h3> <p> A recursive datatype declaration includes itself directly (or indirectly) as a component. A standard example of a recursive data-type is the one of lists. A parametric list can be specified in Z3 as: </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.15">
(declare-datatypes (T) ((Lst nil (cons (hd T) (tl Lst)))))
(declare-const l1 (Lst Int))
(declare-const l2 (Lst Bool))
</pre> <p>The <tt>List</tt> recursive datatype is builtin in Z3. The empty list is <tt>nil</tt>, and the constructor <tt>insert</tt> is used to build new lists. The accessors <tt>head</tt> and <tt>tail</tt> are defined as usual. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.16">
(declare-const l1 (List Int))

</pre> <p>In the example above, we also assert that <tt>l1</tt> and <tt>l2</tt> are not <tt>nil</tt>. This is because the interpretation of <tt>head</tt> and <tt>tail</tt> is underspecified on <tt>nil</tt>. So then head and tail would not be able to distinguish <tt>nil</tt> from <tt>(insert (head nil) (tail nil))</tt>. </p> <h3>Mutually recursive datatypes</h3> <p> You can also specify mutually recursive datatypes for Z3. We list one example below. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.17">

</pre> <p>In the example above, we have a tree of Booleans and a tree of integers. The <tt>leaf</tt> constant must return a tree of a specific sort. To specify the result sort, we use the qualified identifier <tt>(as leaf (Tree Int))</tt>. Note that, we do not need to use a qualified identifer for <tt>value</tt>, since Z3 can infer the intended declaration using the sort of the argument. </p> <h3>Z3 will not prove inductive facts</h3> <p> The ground decision procedures for recursive datatypes don't lift to establishing inductive facts. Z3 does not contain methods for producing proofs by induction. This may change in the future. In particular, consider the following example where the function <tt>p</tt> is true on all natural numbers, which can be proved by induction over <tt>Nat</tt>. Z3 enters a matching loop as it attempts instantiating the universally quantified implication. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.18">

</pre> <h2>Quantifiers</h2> <p> Z3 is a <i>decision procedure</i> for the combination of the previous quantifier-free theories. That is, it can answer whether a quantifier-free formula, modulo the theories referenced by the formula, is satisfiable or whether it is unsatisfiable. Z3 also accepts and can work with formulas that use quantifiers. It is no longer a decision procedure for such formulas in general (and for good reasons, as there can be no decision procedure for first-order logic). </p> <p> Nevertheless, Z3 is often able to handle formulas involving quantifiers. It uses several approaches to handle quantifiers. The most prolific approach is using <i>pattern-based</i> quantifier instantiation. This approach allows instantiating quantified formulas with ground terms that appear in the current search context based on <i>pattern annotations</i> on quantifiers. Another approach is based on <i>saturation theorem proving</i> using a superposition calculus which is a modern method for applying resolution style rules with equalities. The pattern-based instantiation method is quite effective, even though it is inherently incomplete. The saturation based approach is complete for pure first-order formulas, but does not scale as nicely and is harder to predict. </p> <p> Z3 also contains a model-based quantifier instantiation component that uses a model construction to find good terms to instantiate quantifiers with; and Z3 also handles many decidable fragments. </p> <h3>Modeling with Quantifiers</h3> <p> Suppose we want to model an object oriented type system with single inheritance. We would need a predicate for sub-typing. Sub-typing should be a partial order, and respect single inheritance. For some built-in type constructors, such as for <tt>array-of</tt>, sub-typing should be monotone. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.36">

</pre> <h3>Patterns</h3> <p> The Stanford Pascal verifier and the subsequent Simplify theorem prover pioneered the use of pattern-based quantifier instantiation. The basic idea behind pattern-based quantifier instantiation is in a sense straight-forward: Annotate a quantified formula using a <i>pattern</i> that contains all the bound variables. So a pattern is an expression (that does not contain binding operations, such as quantifiers) that contains variables bound by a quantifier. Then instantiate the quantifier whenever a term that matches the pattern is created during search. This is a conceptually easy starting point, but there are several subtleties that are important. </p> <p>In the following example, the first two options make sure that Model-based quantifier instantiation and saturation engines are disabled. We also annotate the quantified formula with the pattern <tt>(f (g x))</tt>. Since there is no ground instance of this pattern, the quantifier is not instantiated, and Z3 fails to show that the formula is unsatisfiable. </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.37">

Z3 uses many heuristics to break matching loops. </p> <p> Before elaborating on the subtleties, we should address an important first question. What defines the terms that are created during search? In the context of most SMT solvers, and of the Simplify theorem prover, terms exist as part of the input formula, they are of course also created by instantiating quantifiers, but terms are also implicitly created when equalities are asserted. The last point means that terms are considered up to congruence and pattern matching takes place modulo ground equalities. We call the matching problem <b>E-matching</b>. For example, if we have the following equalities: </p> <pre class="listing" pref="z3.39">

The QBVF satisfiability problem, is the problem of deciding whether a QBVF is satisfiable modulo the theory of bit-vectors. This problem is decidable because every universal (existental) quantifier can be expanded into a conjunction (disjunction) of potentially exponential, but finite size. A distinguishing feature in QBVF is the support for uninterpreted function and predicate symbols.

</pre> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p> Z3 is an efficient theorem prover used in many software testing, analysis and verification applications. In this tutorial, we covered its main capabilities using the textual interface. However, most applications use the Z3 programmatic <a href="https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/index.html" target="_blank">API</a> to access these features. </p> </body></html>
